# CS-255-projects_

The following are the two projects for the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course at SNHU:

NOTE: the DriverPass System is a fictional system that aims to provide a better learning enviorment and support
to students learning to drive. It contains the ability for students to access learning resources, scheduling appointments
and choosing different package options.

Project One Business Requirements:

This part of project one required that I throughly analyze and document a list of requirements for the DriverPass System based upon a fictional interview transcript.
Some of the documented system details includes its purpose, background, functional requirements and non-functional requirements. It was also neccessary to document 
its potential limitations, performance requirements and so on. At the end of this document, creating a Gantt chart based upon the interview schedule which was part
of the transcript was made.

Project One Appication Short Paper:

The purpose of this part of project one was to write a short paper describing Process Models and Object Models, and how they would be applied to the DriverPass System
in a step by step creation process. At the end I was to compare the two models to each other noting their pros and cons.

Client Presentation:

is a powerpoint for project two where the requirement was to hypotheically describe my diagrams for a certain part of the DriverPass system to a client, 
 the goal of the description was to explain it as simple as possible to practice explaining complex systems to a non-technical audiance. Some of the componants 
 of this powerpoint include providing a Use Case Diagram and an Activity diagram and breaking them down in a simple description. The other sections include 
 providing some of the highlights from the DriverPass system specifically from the previous project one assignment (Project One Business Requirements) and describing 
 some of them in simple context.

 Project Two Diagrams:

 This part of the Project Two assignment was to create 5 diagrams, a Use Case Diagram, 2 Activity Diagrams (login componant and Appointment Scheduling), Sequence Diagram, and
 a class diagram (some of these were included in the client presentation) at the end was to identify and document some of the technical requirements for the DriverPass System 
 from the business requirement document from project one.
