# CS-255-projects_

The following are the two projects for the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course at SNHU:



Project One Business Requirements:

This part of project one required that I throughly analyze and document a list of requirements for the DriverPass System based upon a fictional interview transcript.
Some of the documented system details includes its purpose, background, functional requirements and non-functional requirements. It was also neccessary to document 
its potential limitations, performance requirements and so on. At the end of this document, creating a Gantt chart based upon the interview schedule which was part
of the transcript was made.

Project One Appication Short Paper:

The purpose of this part of project one was to write a short paper describing Process Models and Object Models, and how they would be applied to the DriverPass System
in a step by step creation process. At the end I was to compare the two models to each other noting their pros and cons.

Client Presentation:

is a powerpoint for project two where the requirement was to hypotheically describe my diagrams for a certain part of the DriverPass system to a client, 
 the goal of the description was to explain it as simple as possible to practice explaining complex systems to a non-technical audiance. Some of the componants 
 of this powerpoint include providing a Use Case Diagram and an Activity diagram and breaking them down in a simple description. The other sections include 
 providing some of the highlights from the DriverPass system specifically from the previous project one assignment (Project One Business Requirements) and describing 
 some of them in simple context.

 Project Two Diagrams:

 This part of the Project Two assignment was to create 5 diagrams, a Use Case Diagram, 2 Activity Diagrams (login componant and Appointment Scheduling), Sequence Diagram, and
 a class diagram (some of these were included in the client presentation) at the end was to identify and document some of the technical requirements for the DriverPass System 
 from the business requirement document from project one.

 
Reflection:

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? what type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass System is a fictional system that aims to provide a better learning enviorment and support
to students learning to drive. It contains the ability for students to access learning resources, scheduling appointments
and choosing different package options. The system was to be web-based, accessable through any type of browser so that 
all walks of life could use it. It was also to be cloud-based, and to have its security and back ups managed by a 
third party. The client, similarly named Driverpass is a educational organization aimed at teaching and providing students a 
better experience when it comes to learning how to drive.


What did you do particularly well?

Personally, I think that I handeled the creation of the UML diagrams particularly the activity one, I found it much easier to 
follow than a class diagram which required a lot much technical knowledge since it seemed closer to implimenting actual code. 
The other thing I think I did well in was finding the business requirements for the system, at the start it was difficult
but once you actually start brainstorming it flows rapidly and naturally from there, of course there were some that were 
easily overlooked and required research to pop the idea into your head.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

definitely the UML class diagram, as meantioned because it seemed closer to actual code it required a bit more thinking
and digging up past course work, like Java or C++. That being said, I think that the final result of the diagram could 
be a bit more organized and refined, the location of some classes seemed ineffcient and the relationship lines were not 
neat and could have been potreyed in a simplier manner.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Most of the needs came from the interview transcript, the transcript outlined a few important requirements. for example, the system needed to be logged 
into in order for ANY user's to utilize it because of this the diagram showed that every actor(excluding the DMV) had a direct relationship with the 
login process. Another example was the need for users to be able to reset their passwords if needed and the IT officer had to retain the permissions
to do this manually in the event direct intervention is necessary. In the UML diagram the login use case contained password resetting in its process
with the IT officer actor having a manual reset use case. It is important to consider a user's needs because it ensures that the designs are oriented
towards what a user would actually value and want, this leads to less changes in the future and better satisfation among them. It also helps to make 
a design more useable and marketable setting itself apart from the competition.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

As a person who struggles to get started and likes to have as much information as possible I think that it is important to first
gather requirements and a good understanding as the first part of the approach, that way it will be easier to get started and the 
design will be of good quality from the start. The other technique would be to systematically break down and design the software 
by pieces, if you do it this way its easier to manange and it becomes less complicated. This method also allows for effective testing
allowing each componant to be throughly analyzed before moving on to the next again, improving quality and preventng mistakes. Lastly, 
I think during the design process it is important to stay in close communication to your clients as they only know what they want
and can provide vital feedback on the results of the design.
